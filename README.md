#Introduction
The silent killer that takes lives without warning, punishment, or any sympathy; DEPRESSION. Depression is defined as a mental illness inducing a severe and staunch feeling of sadness. It is one of the leading causes of suicide in whole world, which has become the second leading cause of death among young Indians too. 

Are you depressed? While most people would shy away from admitting it, many others remain unaware of this condition. People are not interested in sharing their problems with others. They don’t consult a counsellor, and even hesitate talking about depression.

‘CureSoul’ will be a Feeling and Healing website for those people who are suffering from depression.  This website consists of an extensive range of music, quotations and poetry covering all aspects of psychology, neuroscience, psychiatry and mental health. 

To simulate the process, CureSoul is developed using MySQL.
